Thanks JJ. I did wonder whether it was unusual for a lawyer to leave a case before its end and knew your experience would provide the answer. I half thought he might just have had enough of all the deceit and lies and opted out, ie a lawyer with a conscience. If he has moved on and out, so to speak, I agree with you, good luck to him.

Thanks JJ. I did wonder whether it was unusual for a lawyer to leave a case before its end and knew your experience would provide the answer. I half thought he might just have had enough of all the deceit and lies and opted out, ie a lawyer with a conscience. If he has moved on and out, so to speak, I agree with you, good luck to him.

FG-- judging from his Twitter posts he appears to be a vulgar old crank.

The other link took me to Coxon's Facebook page-- where, despite his claims to be a "professional", the quality of the photography work he posted appears to be at a very amateur level IMO, and his photos of OP as an athlete show a much younger Oscar. Coxon claims that the "humble" young man he met and photographed could not have committed murder. Many people who knew Oscar in the early days of his career have commented on a change that overtook him as he met with more fame and financial rewards. Perhaps Coxon only knew Oscar before success went to his head.

Anyway, strikes me as a fan-boy (and a serious crank) who was grateful that a world-class athlete gave him the time of day.

Just my impression.

The State's response in full opposing the application to appeal. Andrea Johnson has provided the written argument.

I'm having a good old giggle here reading the State's reply. It's brilliant.

17.9 The two forms of dolus and, with respect, the correct and accepted definition of dolus eventualis were dealt with at paras [26]—[27]. Although this will receive further elucidation, it is perhaps apposite at this point to question the Applicant’s contention that there exists a so-called, or purported, “second component’ for dolus eventualis, namely that of knowledge of unlawfulness. The Applicant eschews any possible support that this definition for dolus eventualis has received in case-law and even in recognized and respected legal writing.

Now that the State has filed its response, we're at the step where the ConCourt must decide whether to grant the application or throw it out. I recall someone posting that this decision typically takes about one month but there is no time scale defined.

19[.6] Appeals
a. The Court shall decide whether or not to grant the appellant leave to appeal.
b. Applications for leave to appeal may be dealt with summarily, without receiving oral or written argument other than that contained in the application itself.
c. The Court may order that the application for leave to appeal be set down for argument and direct that the written argument of the parties deal not only with the question whether the application for leave to appeal should be granted, but also with the merits of the dispute. The provisions of rule 20 shall, with necessary modifications, apply to the procedure to be followed in such procedures.
See http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.z...ofthecourt.htm for full rules.

just reading through... particularly liked para 25, in reference to prima facie/burden of proof/absence of rebuttal. should have been stressed more in the initial case imho.
